;;; Commentary:

;; View air quality data from the World Air Quality Index.
;;
;; The simplest way to view AQI info is with 'M-x aqi-report' which
;; displays air quality info for your algorithmically derived location
;; (equivalent to the location "here") or the name of a place.  A place
;; can be the name of a city (in which case the nearest monitoring
;; station is used) or the name of specific monitoring station.
;;
;; To use the data programmatically, the functions 'aqi-report-full'
;; and 'aqi-report-brief' return the report as a string.  The function
;; 'aqi-city-aqi' will return the AQI for a given city as a number.
